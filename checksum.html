		<h2>Checksum and Hash Algorithms</h2>
		<p>Checksums and hash functions are mathematical tools used to verify data integrity. 
		Checksums like CRC are designed to detect accidental errors in transmission or storage, 
		while cryptographic hashes such as SHA are built to provide stronger guarantees against tampering. 
		Together, they play a vital role in computing, networking, and security.</p>
		<h3>CRC16</h3>
		<p>CRC16 is a smaller 16-bit version of the cyclic redundancy check. It is commonly used in embedded systems 
		and communication protocols where lightweight error detection is sufficient. Like CRC32, it is designed 
		for error detection, not cryptographic security.</p>
		<h3>CRC32</h3>
		<p>CRC32 is a cyclic redundancy check that produces a 32-bit value. It is widely used in file formats, 
		network protocols, and storage devices to detect accidental changes in data. While fast and efficient, 
		it is not secure against intentional tampering.</p>
		<h3>MD5</h3>
		<p>MD5 generates a 128-bit hash value and was once popular for verifying file integrity. However, it is now 
		considered cryptographically broken because collisions can be found easily. Today, MD5 is used only for 
		non-security purposes such as quick checksums.</p>
		<h3>SHA-1</h3>
		<p>SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash and was widely used in digital signatures and certificates. It is now 
		deprecated for security applications because researchers have demonstrated practical collision attacks. 
		Despite this, it still appears in legacy systems.</p>
		<h3>SHA-256</h3>
		<p>SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family and generates a 256-bit hash. It is currently one of the most widely 
		used secure hashing algorithms, powering SSL/TLS certificates, blockchain technologies, and secure file 
		verification.</p>
		<h3>SHA-384</h3>
		<p>SHA-384 is another member of the SHA-2 family, producing a 384-bit hash. It offers stronger security 
		margins than SHA-256 and is often used in government and enterprise applications where higher assurance 
		is required.</p>
		<h3>SHA-512</h3>
		<p>SHA-512 outputs a 512-bit hash and is the largest variant of the SHA-2 family. It provides very strong 
		resistance against collisions and preimage attacks, though it is slower on 32-bit systems. It is favored 
		in environments where maximum security is needed.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>From simple checksums like CRC16 and CRC32 to legacy hashes such as MD5 and SHA-1, and finally to modern 
		secure algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, the evolution of these techniques reflects the growing 
		need for stronger protection against data corruption and malicious attacks. While older methods remain useful 
		for error detection, modern cryptographic hashes are essential for ensuring trust and security in today’s 
		digital world.</p>
